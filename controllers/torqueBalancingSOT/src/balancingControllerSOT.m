    % ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    % Let
    %
    % 1)  u := [jointTorques,
    %           contactForces] \in R^{nDof+6nc}
    %
    % Then, the equations of motion in the centroidal coordinates write
    %
    % 2)  M(q)nuD + h(q,nu) = Bu
    %
    % with M block diagonal and
    %
    % 3a) B   := [S,J_c^t], 
    %
    % 3b) S   := [0_{6xnDof}
    %             eye(nDof)],
    %
    % 3c) J_c := [jacobianLeftFoot*deltaL
    %             jacobianRightFoot*deltaR],
    %
    % with deltaL and deltaR two "activating" functions being either 0 or 1
    % depending on contact conditions such as measured forces, etc.
    % The holonomic constraints acting on the system represent the fact
    % that the robot's feet do not move. They can be compactly written as
    % 
    % 4) J_cDot*nu + J_c * nuDot = 0,
    %
    % i.e. the feet accelerations are equal to zero.
    %
    % ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    % Control objective
    % ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    % The control objective is the stabilization of the following outputs:
    %
    %   i) Center of mass;
    %  ii) Orientation of the base;
    % iii) Pose of left foot;
    %  iv) Pose of right foot.
    %
    % Now, let J_G, J_B, J_R, J_L, denote the jacobians of the center of
    % mass, base orientation, right, and left foot frame, respectively. 
    % Define
    %
    %
    %  5) J := [J_G;
    %           J_B;
    %           J_L;
    %           J_R];
    %
    % Therefore, the acceleration of the outputs i-iv stuck together are:
    %
    %  6) JDot * nu + J * nuDot = aOut
    %
    % In view of Eq. 2), one has:
    %
    %  7) JDot * nu + J * inv(M) * (Bu - h) = aTask
   
    % and aTaskDes such that the output functions i-iv are stabilized
    % towards desired values.
    % 
    % Now, the variable u0 is found such that the joint dynamics is imposed
    % at desired values. 
    %
    % Hence, we would like to find u such that B * u - h = feedback action
    % on joint control while satisfying the equality constraint 7).
    %
    % In the language of optimization theory, we solve
    %
    % 11) u* = argmin (1/2)*|S^t * inv(M) * (B * u - h) + tauFeedback|^2
    %           s.t.
    %               Cu < b
    %               JDot * nu + J * inv(M) * (B * u - h) = aTaskDes
    %               tauFeedback = kp * qTilde + kd * qTildeDot
    %
    % and aTaskDes such that the output functions i-iv are stabilized
    % towards desired values.
